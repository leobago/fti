*FTI stands for Fault Tolerance Interface and is a library that aims to give
*computational scientists the means to perform fast and efficient multilevel
*checkpointing in large scale supercomputers. FTI leverages local storage plus
*data replication and erasure codes to provide several levels of reliability and
*performance. FTI is application-level checkpointing and allows users to select
*which datasets needs to be protected, in order to improve efficiency and avoid
*wasting space, time and energy. In addition, it offers a direct data interface
*so that users do not need to deal with files and/or directory names.  All
*metadata is managed by FTI in a transparent fashion for the user. If desired,
*users can dedicate one process per node to overlap fault tolerance workload and
*scientific computation, so that post-checkpoint tasks are executed
*asynchronously.

*
*##########   Download, compile and install FTI (as easy as 1,2,3)   ##########
*
* 1) git clone https://github.com/leobago/fti.git
*
* 2) mkdir fti/build && cd fti/build
*
* 3) cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/install/here/fti .. && make all install
* 
* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
*
* NOTICE
* For the case that both, intel and gnu compilers are installed, please confi-
* gure using:
*
* cmake -C ../intel.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/install/here/fti ..
*
* To use built-in MD5 rather than OpenSSL, please configure using:
*
* cmake -DNO_OPENSSL=true -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/install/here/fti ..
*
*##########   Configure and run a FTI example (as easy as 1,2,3)     ##########
*
* 1) Place yourself in the examples directory which contains head distribution
* examples in both C and Fortran.
*
*    - cd examples
*
* 2) With your favorite text editor open and edit the FTI configuration file
* config.fti to set the three directory variables.
*
*    - vim config.fti (Edit Ckpt_dir, Glbl_dir, Meta_dir)
*
* 3) Make sure that FTI library is accessible in you LD_LIBRARY_PATH, set the
* FTIPATH in the Makefile, compile and launch the test.
*
*    - make all hdt
*
*
*##########   Acknowledgement (send us a postal card! \(^-^)/)       ##########
*
*
*If you use FTI please consider sending us an email to let us know what you
*liked and what could be improved, your feedback is important. Also, please make
*sure to acknowledge our paper "FTI: High Performance Fault Tolerance Interface
*for Hybrid Systems".  Finally, don't hesitate to send us a postal card.
