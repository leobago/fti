Configuration
=================

[Basic]
-------

head
^^^^


..

   The checkpointing safety levels L2, L3 and L4 produce additional overhead due to the necessary postprocessing work on the checkpoints. FTI offers the possibility to create an MPI process, called HEAD, in which this postprocessing will be accomplished. This allows it for the application processes to continue the execution immediately after the checkpointing.  


.. list-table::

   * - Value
     - Meaning
   * - 0
     - The checkpoint postprocessing work is covered by the application processes
   * - 1
     - The HEAD process accomplishes the checkpoint postprocessing work (notice: In this case, the number of application processes will be (n-1)/node)


(\ *default = 0*\ )  

node_size
^^^^^^^^^


..

   Lets FTI know, how many processes will run on each node (ppn). In most cases this will be the amount of processing units within the node (e.g. 2 CPUâ€™s/node and 8 cores/CPU ! 16 processes/node).

   * - 4
     - FTI prints only errors

[Restart]
---------

failure
^^^^^^^


..

   This setting should mainly set by FTI itself. The behaviour within FTI is the following:
     


   * Within ``FTI_Init()``\ , it remains on it initial value.
   * After the first checkpoint is taken, it is set to 1.
   * After ``FTI_Finalize()`` and ``keep_last_ckpt`` = 0, it is set to 0.
   * After ``FTI_Finalize()`` and ``keep_last_ckpt`` = 1, it is set to 2.

   * - Value
     - Meaning
   * - 0
     - The application starts with its initial conditions (notice: In order to force a clean start, the value may be set to 0 manually. In this case the user has to take care about removing the checkpoint data from the last execution)

     - FTI is searching for checkpoints and starts from the highest checkpoint level (notice: If no readable checkpoints are found, the execution stops)
   * - 2

(\ *default = 0*\ )  

exec_id
^^^^^^^


..

   This setting should mainly set by FTI itself. During ``FTI_Init()`` the execution ID is set if the application starts for the first time (failure = 0) or the execution ID is used by FTI in order to find the checkpoint files for the case of a restart (\ ``failure`` = 1,2)


.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Value
     - Meaning

(\ *default = 3107*\ )  

lustre_striping_unit

   * - -1
     - Assigns the Lustre default value


(\ *default = -1*\ )  

local_test
^^^^^^^^^^


..

   FTI is building the topology of the execution, by determining the hostnames of the nodes on which each process runs. Depending on the settings for ``group_size``\ , ``node_size`` and ``head``\ , FTI assigns each particular process to a group and decides which process will be Head or Application dedicated. This is meant to be a local test. In certain situations (e.g. to run FTI on a local machine) it is necessary to disable this function.


.. list-table::

     - Meaning
   * - 0
     - Local test is disabled. FTI will simulate the situation set in the configuration
